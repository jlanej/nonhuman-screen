on the Python standard library and a ``kraken2`` executable on ``PATH``; it

class Kraken2Runner:
    """Classify reads with kraken2 and tally non-human content.

    Wraps the ``kraken2`` binary in a subprocess-based interface.  Reads
    are written to a temporary FASTQ, classified, and the kraken2 per-read
    output is
    parsed to count how many reads are classified as bacterial
    (``taxid 2``), archaeal (``taxid 2157``), fungal (``taxid 4751``),
    protist (eukaryotic but not metazoan, fungal, or plant), viral
    (``taxid 10239``), or non-human (any classified read definitively
    outside the human lineage).  All non-human tallies apply a
    conservative **human homology guard**: if a read's k-mer detail
    string includes any k-mer that voted for human (taxid 9606), the
    read is excluded from every non-human numerator.

    Viral reads receive the same human homology guard as all other
    non-human categories.  This is particularly important for viruses
    that can integrate into the human genome (e.g. endogenous
    retroviruses, HBV, HPV), whose integrated copies may share k-mers
    with the human reference.  A read carrying both viral and human
    k-mer evidence is conservatively excluded from the viral count.

    **UniVec Core handling**: PrackenDB includes UniVec Core (taxid
    81077), a curated set of synthetic sequencing-vector and adapter
    sequences.  These are artificial constructs and do not represent
    genuine biological contamination.  Reads classified under UniVec
    Core are tracked independently (``univec_core_read_names`` /
    ``univec_core_count``) and explicitly excluded from the consolidated
    non-human fraction (NHF) so that vector library-preparation
    artefacts — or human reads whose k-mers happen to match vector
    sequences — are not errantly counted as microbial contamination.
    The human homology guard is applied first; UniVec Core exclusion
    provides a second, unconditional safety net for any
    UniVec-classified read regardless of k-mer voting.

    The ``--confidence`` threshold (default 0.0) controls how strict
    the LCA classification must be.  A value of 0.2 requires at least
    20 % of k-mers in the read to agree on the assigned clade.

    **Failure handling**: by default (``strict=True``) a kraken2 run that
    exits non-zero, or whose per-read output does not account for every
    input read, raises :class:`Kraken2Error` rather than returning a
    zero-filled result.  Reporting a failed run as "0 % non-human" would
    be a false negative that reads as a clean sample, so it fails loudly
    instead.  With ``strict=False`` both cases log a warning and set
    ``Result.classification_failed``; callers must then check that flag.

    **Database requirement**: the database's taxonomy must contain the
    human node (taxid 9606) — every mainstream database does, including
    PrackenDB.  Without it the human lineage/clade exclusions resolve to
    empty sets and the human-homology guard can never fire, so a warning
    is logged when the taxonomy is loaded (see :meth:`_load_all_taxid_sets`).

            human_lineage_count: Number of human-lineage reads (see

        ``protist``, ``viral``, ``univec_core``, ``human_lineage``, and
        ``human_clade``.  Each value is a set of NCBI taxonomy IDs.

        ``protist`` is defined as eukaryotic taxa that are **not**
        Metazoa, Fungi, or Viridiplantae.

        ``viral`` contains all descendants of Viruses (taxid 10239).
        Reads classified as viral are treated with particular care because
        some viruses (e.g. endogenous retroviruses, HBV, HPV) can integrate
        into the human genome. The human homology guard (checking for human
        k-mer evidence in the per-read detail string) conservatively
        excludes any read with both viral and human k-mer evidence from
        the viral numerator.

        ``univec_core`` contains all descendants of UniVec Core (taxid
        81077), a set of synthetic sequencing-vector and adapter sequences
        included in PrackenDB.  These artificial constructs are excluded
        from the consolidated non-human fraction unconditionally: they do
        not represent biological contamination and may share k-mers with
        human DNA, so classifying them as non-human would produce false
        positives.

        ``human_lineage`` contains every taxid on the path from human
        (9606) to root — these are taxonomic ranks too broad to be
        confidently assigned as non-human.

        ``human_clade`` contains human (9606) and any descendant
        subspecies or populations.

        **The taxonomy must contain the human node (taxid 9606).**  When it
        does not — a microbial-only or otherwise custom database — both
        ``human_lineage`` and ``human_clade`` resolve to the empty set, and
        the "not on the human lineage" rule then admits *every* classified
        taxid, including root (1) and cellular organisms (131567).  The
        human-homology guard is equally inoperative, since no k-mer can vote
        for a taxon the database does not contain.  A warning is logged in
        that case; the returned sets are still used, so callers get the
        (over-counting) behaviour plus a loud diagnostic rather than a
        silent change of meaning.
