"""Result value objects for non-human read screening.

These dataclasses turn the low-level :class:`~nonhuman_screen.engine.Kraken2Runner`
``Result`` (a bag of per-domain read-name sets) into the two reductions
callers actually want:

* :class:`TaxonomicFractions` — per-domain fractions over an arbitrary set of
  reads, either the whole batch or the reads supporting one variant allele.
* :class:`VariantNHF` — the non-human fraction of the reads supporting a single
  variant's ALT allele, i.e. the "allele-based NHF" primitive.

``result.py`` intentionally imports nothing from :mod:`nonhuman_screen.engine`
so that ``engine`` can depend on it without a cycle.  It reads domain read-name
sets off any object exposing the ``*_read_names`` attributes.
